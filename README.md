x86 Assembly Project ‚Äì ASC Lab Assignment 2024
This repository contains the complete solution for the ASC (Arhitectura Sistemelor de Calcul) Lab Assignment 2024 at the University of Bucharest. The project is implemented in x86 Assembly and adheres strictly to the guidelines provided in the official assignment document.

üìã Project Overview
The assignment is divided into two main parts, each focusing on different aspects of low-level programming and computer architecture:

  Part 1: Data Processing & Computation
Objective: Perform operations on numeric data as per the assignment‚Äôs specifications.
Features:
Input/Output Handling: Reading signed integers from the user or a file.
Arithmetic & Logical Operations: Executing required computations, such as summing, filtering, or manipulating data based on the assignment rules.
Result Display: Outputting the processed results in a clear, user-friendly format.
Learning Outcomes: Reinforces understanding of register manipulation, arithmetic operations, and memory addressing in x86 Assembly.
  Part 2: Advanced Control Structures & Data Manipulation
Objective: Implement more complex control flow and data manipulation routines.
Features:
  Conditional Logic & Looping: Implementing decision-making structures (e.g., if/else conditions, loops) to handle dynamic data.
String or Structured Data Processing: Depending on the task‚Äôs specifics, processing character strings or structured data inputs.
  Optimized Performance: Emphasizing efficient use of registers and memory for real-time processing.
Learning Outcomes: Deepens knowledge of branch instructions, loop constructions, and system call interactions in a low-level programming environment.
  ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Tools
Assembler: NASM (Netwide Assembler) for compiling x86 Assembly code.
Platform: Designed to run on Linux (with potential DOS adaptations as required).
Debugger: GDB for troubleshooting and stepping through assembly instructions.
Build Tools: A provided Makefile for streamlined assembling, linking, and execution.
